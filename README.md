# haskell-musings
My personal Haskell playground. Mostly for practice for now. 

To run it, use [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). That's the only way I know how to run Haskell projects for now unfortunately, but it's worked great for me, so give it a try ðŸ˜€.

Once armed with stack, run 

`stack build`

Then play around with things and have fun.
